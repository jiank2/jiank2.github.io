            <p class="h3">Abstract</p>
            <p>Graph is a ubiquitous type of data that appears in many real-world applications, including social network
                analysis, recommendations and financial security. Important as it is, decades of research have developed
                plentiful computational models to mine graphs. Despite its prosperity, concerns with respect to the
                potential algorithmic discrimination have been grown recently. Algorithmic fairness on graphs, which
                aims to mitigate bias introduced or amplified during the graph mining process, is an attractive yet
                challenging research topic. The first challenge corresponds to the theoretical challenge, where the
                non-IID nature of graph data may not only invalidate the basic assumption behind many existing studies
                in fair machine learning, but also introduce new fairness definition(s) based on the inter-correlation
                between nodes rather than the existing fairness definition(s) in fair machine learning. The second
                challenge regarding its algorithmic aspect aims to understand how to balance the trade-off between model
                accuracy and fairness. This tutorial aims to (1) comprehensively review the state-of-the-art techniques
                to enforce algorithmic fairness on graphs and (2) enlighten the open challenges and future directions.
                We believe this tutorial could benefit researchers and practitioners from the areas of data mining,
                artificial intelligence and social science.</p>
